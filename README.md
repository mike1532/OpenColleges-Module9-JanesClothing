# OpenColleges-Module9-JanesClothing
This is the ongoing activity through module 9. The UI has been created and stored in the presentation layer folder (please forgive the lack of organisation/consistency on the winform controls, this is the first UI that I have created, things will get better =D). Customer and Product classes have been created/stored in the business logic layer. 

About to link up the Sales database that we created in module 5 to the application. Wish me luck!!
